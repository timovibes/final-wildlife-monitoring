# Wildlife & Biodiversity Monitoring System

A comprehensive, full-stack application designed to track wildlife sightings, manage conservation data, and report critical incidents in protected areas and conservation zones.

## Overview

The Wildlife & Biodiversity Monitoring System is a modern web-based platform that enables rangers, researchers, and administrators to:

- **Record Wildlife Sightings**: Log detailed observations of animals with geographic coordinates, behavior patterns, and photographic evidence
- **Track Conservation Status**: Monitor endangered and vulnerable species using IUCN Red List classifications
- **Incident Management**: Report and track wildlife-related incidents including poaching, human-wildlife conflict, habitat destruction, and injuries
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Simulate and validate high-frequency IoT sensor data from GPS collars and camera traps
- **Access Control**: Role-based dashboard for Admins, Rangers, and Researchers with appropriate permissions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Modern web browser with ES6+ support

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timovibes/final-wildlife-monitoring.git
   cd final-wildlife-monitoring
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   
   # Configure environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials and settings
   
   # Seed the database with initial data
   npm run seed
   
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Start the development server
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000/api

## Authentication & Authorization

The system implements role-based access control (RBAC) with three primary roles:

### Admin
- Full system access
- User and species management
- Incident oversight and approval
- System analytics and reporting

### Ranger
- Wildlife sighting recording
- Personal incident reporting
- Limited species catalog access
- Dashboard with personal statistics

### Researcher
- Advanced data querying
- Scientific analysis tools
- Read-only access to sightings and incidents
- Species database contributions (pending approval)

## Data Models

### Sighting
Captures wildlife observations with geographic precision and behavior context:
- Species reference with count
- Observer identification
- Precise coordinates (lat/long)
- Behavioral observations
- Weather conditions
- Photo documentation
- Verification status

### Species
Maintains comprehensive wildlife species information:
- Common and scientific names
- Taxonomic category
- IUCN conservation status
- Habitat and population data
- Images and descriptions

### Incident
Tracks intervention-requiring events:
- Incident type classification
- Severity and status tracking
- Species and affected area
- Reporter accountability
- Geographic location
- Impact assessment

### IoTData
Simulates real sensor device data:
- Sensor identification
- Device type (GPS collar, camera trap)
- Geographic and temporal data
- Battery and motion metrics
- Data quality indicators

## Testing & Data Generation

The project includes a comprehensive seed file with sample data:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This initializes the database with:
- Test user accounts across all roles

## Workflow Examples

### Recording a Wildlife Sighting
1. Ranger logs into dashboard
2. Clicks "Record Sighting"
3. Selects species from database
4. Inputs location (auto-populated from device GPS or manual entry)
5. Records behavior and weather conditions
6. Optionally attaches photo
7. Submits for system ingestion
8. Admin receives notification for verification

### Reporting a Critical Incident
1. Ranger identifies wildlife-related incident
2. Selects incident type (e.g., Poaching)
3. Indicates severity level and species affected
4. Provides location and detailed description
5. System auto-alerts admins based on severity
6. Incident status tracked through resolution workflow
7. Analytics track incident patterns and hotspots

## Analytics & Insights

The system supports analysis through:
- Species population trend analysis
- Incident hotspot mapping
- Ranger performance metrics
- Data quality dashboards
